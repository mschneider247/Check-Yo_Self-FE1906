## General Info
Final Project for Turing, Mod1 FE 1906. Implement all skills learned to date.

## Motivation
Time was a limiting factor and instructors expected us to demonstrate everything we had learned over the course. Code was kept as simple as possible while pursuing expectations. Primary focus was in building a clear and re-usable Data-Model.

## Built With
* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript

## Features
* Create new to-do lists
* Add tasks to those to-dos
* Edit tasks while they are still being built
* Modify to-do lists by checking off tasks
* Set to-dos as urgent
* Delete to-dos when all tasks have been completed
* If a to-do is urgent, click the urgent button to update its status

## How to Use
* Add a new title for a to-do by mousing over the Task Title input. If there is any value in the input field, it becomes a new to-do!
* Add tasks to your to-do by entering a value into the Task Item box and pressing '+'.
* If you change your mind about a task, hit the delete icon to its left and it will be removed. 
* If you change your mind about the entire to-do, simply hit 'clear all'.
* Once a to-do has been generated, click off its tasks with the icon to its left in the card.
* If its a really important to-do, mark it as urgent!.
